# fun_stuff
A collection of some fun coding that I have played around with in the past.

**php_css**
Just a sample that I had done a while back. I was playing around with the idea of using a php file as a css file.
I think that it had the potential to do some interesting things. 

**example_sorter**
This is an example JS file that I once did for a project. I would like to go back and clean this code up someday make it more of a jquery plugin.
This was initially created for a web project in which a long list of sponsors were on one page and that list needed to be easier to navigate.
